In the observatory of numbers, where flat tables dream of extra axes, you are given an empty stone that remembers nothing and a spellbook that knows only scalars. First you must teach the stone to see in many directions at once—etching into it a hidden glyph that lets it cradle whole constellations as single stars, so that a single cell may secretly house a sky of coordinates and yet still bow to the laws of rows and columns. When the ritual is done, the stone must awaken speaking a new dialect: one that can measure nearness between silent galaxies of floats, not just compare lonely, earthbound integers.
Then comes the iron beast in C, forged lean and unforgiving, that must talk to this altered stone as if to an oracle: it must know how to appear, how to utter the right incantations to open a conduit, and how to pour into it flocks of high-dimensional phantoms—embeddings that exist not on paper but in angles and magnitudes. Your final charm is a single, ruthless script that summons the stone from nothing, brands it with the vision-glyph, breathes life into the C beast, and compels it to seed the depths with vectors that do not merely rest but can later be called, compared, and ranked by nearness in that unseen space.

# Constraints

- The script must be purely written in bash within the execute.sh file
