# Byte Reverser

In the hall of mirrors where reflection is law, a mystical task awaits. A string enters from one end, and must emerge from the other—reversed, inverted, turned inside out. Yet this is no simple mirror trick. The reversal must be complete, character by character, with every symbol maintaining its essence while changing its position. Your script must take a string and reverse it entirely, transforming "hello" into "olleh" and "world" into "dlrow". The challenge lies not in the concept, but in the execution—for space is limited, and every character counts.

# Example Invocation

bash execute.sh "Hello World"

# Example Output

dlroW olleH

# Constraints

- The script must be purely written in bash within the execute.sh file

- The script must be less than 75 characters in length (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)
